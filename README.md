# Flask + GraphQL + MySQL + Docker

Little experiment to learn GraphQL's workings and how it interacts with Flask.

Seen on https://github.com/fluxitsoft/skills-app, however, I've smoothed out some of the details so that it's easier to add new Models, Objects, Mutations or Queries.

The structural changes are such, that I believe it warrants a repo being made, and not forked.
